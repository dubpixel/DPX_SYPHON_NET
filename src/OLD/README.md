# DPX_SYPHON_NET
free set of patches that allow sending of syphon to fullscreen, or another syphon input  - over a UDP network. 

these are basically provided free, because some twit was charging 20 bucks to do this with a smaller featureset. 
i do not have the binaries hosted anywhere, but can make some if people want.

i honestly havent used these in a few years, as im typing this, and have no idea if they still  work. 
they probably do, but who knows?

if you try them, let me know:
